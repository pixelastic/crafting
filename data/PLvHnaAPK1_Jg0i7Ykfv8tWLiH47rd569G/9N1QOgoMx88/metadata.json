  "description": "You wake up in a dripping concrete chamber. A massive padlock bars the only exit, and a maze of lightless passages winds between you and the key. Navigate the claustrophobic dark before the dark water rises, and hope to make it out before you meet the guardian of the tunnels.\n\nPick up this awesome game here: http://survivethenightgames.com/\n\nIn this build we begin the deathtrap dungeon of Aqualung.
